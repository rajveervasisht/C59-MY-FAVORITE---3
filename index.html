        <h1> About my hobby</h1>
        <p id="bio">Hobby is something through which you can pass your free time. I learned about the wonders of the world, space travel, human achievements, gigantic whales, tiny viruses and other fascinating things of our world.
            The wonderful thing about reading is that I do not have to learn things the hard way.For example, I do not have to catch a disease to know that it can make me stick to bed for days or even kill me.Reading helps me in many ways. My general knowledge has increased. I participated and won many quiz contests, science contests with the help of my hobby. It improves my grammar and vocabulary. </p>
